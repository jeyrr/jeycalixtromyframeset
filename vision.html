<center>About Skye
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left> Skye is derived from the Norse word ski meaning ‘cloud’ and ey, ‘island’. Designer Alexander McQueen’s ashes were scattered on Skye. Twelve of the peaks in the Black Cuillin , Skye’s famous mountain range, are munros. One of the island’s most famous visitors was Bonnie Prince Charlie, who arrived in 1745 disguised as a serving maid.
