<center>About Reyna
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left>Reyna takes what she wants when she wants it, no matter who is standing in her way. Savage and almost animalistic, she is not one to hesitate when it comes to eliminating her enemies and getting blood on her hands. She has a strong dislike for technology and thrives on the enemy's misery, and loves to compete with fellow Radiants to see who is the most powerful.

She seems to have a cynical view towards the rest of the world due to the pain that she has experienced in order to survive. However, she acknowledges that her Earth is still her home, and she resolves to defend it even if it means spilling more blood.

Appearance
Reyna is often seen with the edges of her long hair dyed purple. Her sharp purple eyes make her menacing to look at, almost giving her the impression of a beast. She is relatively exposed, wearing a purple skin-tight suit that only has one arm covered with the other exposed. Her exposed arm reveals a set of unique tattoos that glows whenever she activates her radiant powers. She wears a pair of purple boots with plating that covers the entirety of her legs, save for her right thigh which is left exposed.

A bright purple glow is always seen on her chest where her heart is located. When she activates her Empress state, her entire body turns into a shade of dark purple, with her eyes, hands, and heart glowing brightest with an amethyst shade.
