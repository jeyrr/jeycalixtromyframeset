<center>About Sova
<br><br>
<font size=5 color=white><p align=center-left>Sova has a fair skin tone and sports long blond hair that flows down to his shoulders. He has a bionic right eye with blue lenses. He is seen wearing a fur-lined coat suited for the cold weather of his home along with a dark blue cape with a white leaf-shaped symbol on the left shoulder and a X-shape on the back. He wears archery leather gloves and his owl drone rests against his left forearm. His bow is slung across his back in an easy-to-reach position. His boots take on the appearance of owls. His quiver of shock darts is located on the side of his right thigh and he has a hunting knife strapped against his left calf.
